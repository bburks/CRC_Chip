We simulated using the following parameters:

times = [0, 2, 4, 6]

[p1, p2] = [1000, 100]
measurement error = 0.1
growth = 1

l12 = (0.1, 1) (10 values)
l12 = (0.1, 1) (10 values)

ranges: 
l12, l21: (0, 1)
growth (0, 10)
measurement error: (0, 1)



For each of these 100 parameter choices, we simulated 10 replicates, then performed MLE from a random starting point in the ranges given to find the optimal parameters. 
For each of the 100 simulations, only one starting point was required in order to find parameters with a likelihood higher than the likelihood of parameters used to simulate the data.

This image shows the average (RMS) distance of 4 found parameters from the four actual parameters (normalized to their size)
